# machine-learning
This repo is for the programming assignments for the Stanford Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Cousera class. 
I've included the Octave solutions (thank you [Lewuathe](https://github.com/Lewuathe/cousera-assignment)) to to pass the assignments, while working through the problems using Python and Numpy.
